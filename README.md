# Applied Data Science with Python Specialization from University of Michigan

## Overview
[Applied Data Science with Python Specialization from University of Michigan](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) is an intermediate level path composed to five courses, all with a practical approach.

This specialization cover:
- Analyze the connectivity of a social network
- Conduct an inferential statistical analysis
- Discern whether a data visualization is good or bad
- Enhance a data analysis with applied machine learning
